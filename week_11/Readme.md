# Todo for this week - Monday Journal\
- EPMATH153
- Fix bug on portfolio

# LTI Journal - Wednesday Journal - How to make a good resume
- First look at current jobs in the field on linkedin and see what the average required skills are.
- Add all your relevant contact information like LinkedIn, phone number, email. However if you link a social media make sure that it is a good representation of you.
- Look at the job you want to get and the knowledge they want / soft skills and hard skills.
- Include your skills and experience in the resume but make sure they are relevant to the job you want, a resume with cooking skills wont land you a job if you want to do software engineering. Try to stay away from typical online course work.
- Include your relevant education / training completed.
- Make sure your resume stands out however you want it easy to read and not too flashy
- Get someone to look over your resume and give you feedback, typically someone who is the field.
- Goodluck and you got this
