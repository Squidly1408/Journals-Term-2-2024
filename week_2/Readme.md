# Todo for this week - Monday Journal
- Gather / order all of the parts to Strocoge
- Learning Plan Meeting

# LTI Journal - Wednesday Journal
#SAPHI LTI Journal

##Start of the day
I came to my LTI and there are two new people here, I am yet to say 'Hello' to them, they look like they are working hard.
I can't wait to learn what I am doing today, however Liam, the one who usually set goals for me is in a meeting right now. I also need to get the WIFI password 


Things wrong with website:

Homepage:
Typo - [Saphi make] emerging technology
?Design? - ?Saphi isn't bolded and kind of hard to read? 


##middle of the day
I am enjoying my time at SAPHI, although my work is quite monotonous, I'm cropping images then using a certain program to select speed signs for a camera ai that SAPHI is making. its meant to understand speed signs and how the driver is acting via two cameras, one facing the driver and another facing the road ahead. its meant to detect if the driver is driving safely or not, if the driver is sleepy, or a risk to themselves or others on the road. I hope future engineering roles aren't this repetitive and monotonous, because its kind of boring although I understand that it is one of the things that is needed for SAPHI. 
I also have another question, would I want to do software engineering or would getting a degree in mechatronics be better, and if yes would i even be able to do it. the answer to this is no, I believe it is a little late for me to try and get a degree in mechatronics engineering, if want to i could probably do a course like https://www.tafensw.edu.au/course-areas/electrotechnology/courses/certificate-ii-in-electronics--UEE21920-01 that after my UON degree. however i do believe coding isn't everything that software engineers do, i do believe its a major part of software engineering however I believe there is much more mundane things the task that i was assigned at SAPHI today.

##End of the day
I've really enjoyed today, i had fun and laughed with the people at SAPHI, I also posted a linkedIn post about being back at SAPHI.

# Journal Task - Friday Journal - reviewing feedback about portfolio

A few days ago whgen writing this I got Andrew Forrer, the LTI co-ordinator to review my Portfolio, this is the result:

The design is clean and is easy to navigate.
The OneDrive link to your Future Pathway Plan and Autobiography didn’t work (you may well know this already) and some of the other “buttons” didn’t seem to work either.
I would love to see some images of the AUSLAN glove for example as it is not always easy to visualise what you have created and I think this would benefit visitors to the site.
On the home page, would it be more effective to have the subtitle as “Design, development and deployment of programs and electronics”.
The video is great and has a nice individualised nature to it, with a touch of humour. The music is very dramatic but perhaps you are going for a Mission Impossible vibe.

All this is good feedback however it brings up changes I need to make on my portfolio, I need to re-link all the external links like link to my autobiography and such. To do this I will need to open my code in the IDE (Intergrated Devlopment Enviroment) and then I will need find the files in my Onedrive and if they arnt in my Onedrive I need to add them to a section where they won't be deleted again.

I Have just implemented these changes then uploaded them to My Github Pages.
