# Todo for this week - Monday Journal

# LTI Journal - Wednesday Journal
##Morning Journal
Today I arrived at SAPHI not knowing what to do, however today I want to work on my glove project using SAPHI resources and tools, for this to happen I need to ask if I can do this. Liam also hasn't replied to my email last tuesday about me working at SAPHI and future prospects.

##Midday
I have gotten an update on the email I sent and Cam and Liam need to have a chat but stuff has been hetic so far. ALso I haver planned some websites I want to make. I am also going to start doing the AI training again since that was cool and i actually enjoyed it.
