I have arrived at SAPHI and two people are here, Eric, and somebody new. So guess I will have to wait until Cam is here because I believe I am having the meeting today about me working at SAPHI. I am so excited, This is like my dream job, so being able to have it this early is an amazing thing, now I know its just one day a week but being able to work in a place that I feel comfortable in, the co-workers are amazing people, and the atmosphere is just, just awesome. Plus I get to do what I love, OMG.
