# Todo for this week - Monday Journal

# LTI - Wednesday Journal
I sent an email about my future to Cameron from SAPHI, I sent this:
I was thinking about my future as a software developer and was wondering what the chances would be for me to start a career at Saphi right after high school? or would I need to go to university or an equivalent to be considered?

And he replied this:
I would recommend you start Uni as I believe it will expose you to  different areas and fields of software development that might help you decide what direction you want to go. I also remember Uni as one of the best times of my life. Donâ€™t rush into full time work if you can avoid it!
However, what I can do is give you part time work while studying if you wanted? Once you graduate you can come on full time? 

This is big for me as this provides me a job in the feild as i go to UNI.
