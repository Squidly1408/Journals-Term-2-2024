# LTI Journal - Wednesday Journal
I went to a new possible LTI at UON, creating a podcast about aboriginal history and newcastle, This first session was about getting to know each other and understanding whats in the podcast and what will be reqiured of us. I sadly don't think this podcast thing is for me, i believe I won't be of any help and will only drag things down.
