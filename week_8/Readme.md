I arrived at SAPHI early to find out that Liam was already here, so, I went in and said hi! He told me that when Cam comes in hes going to set me to do some tasks, I have feeling that it is goig to be the AI image recognition training data stuff again, although i am a little sad about it not being a exciting task I am happy that I can contribute to a real world project.
