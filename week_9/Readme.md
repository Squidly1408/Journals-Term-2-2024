## school to work
1. Network And Practice Interviewing

Graduating can be an exciting and stressful time for seniors. It can be easy to forget the basics of job searching -- networking and interviews. Remember to keep your contacts as you collaborate on projects or work with teachers for possible future letters of recommendation or job referrals. Also, practice interviewing with friends or teachers to help you be prepared for when the time comes. - Kelly Loudermilk, BuildHR, Inc.

2. Know What You're Passionate About

Really putting thought into what they are passionate about is important in identifying the right job or career. College and high school counselors can assist with personality profiles, but talking with friends and family about what you are good at and drawn to will also help. My advice: try things! Don’t wait until you are sure. Take chances and try various options. - Diane Strohfus, Betterworks.com

3. Learn To Expand Your Personal Boundaries

The ability to set appropriate boundaries rises as a key marker of psychological well-being because we're constantly being pulled in multiple directions. The challenge for young people is that moving into work life requires shifting personal boundaries to include the needs/demands of colleagues and team. This is a key factor for success. - Leeno Karumanchery, PhD, MESH/Diversity

4. Do Your Leg Work

Research a few companies you’re interested in and contact their HR to see if they have short-term intern programs or job shadow days. Get your foot in the door by showing eagerness to take a paid or unpaid opportunity to work in your field of interest. Potential employers are impressed by candidates that are proactive and enthusiastic. The experience will also help build your resume. - Regina Romeo, CPS HR Consulting

5. Identify Company Values You Can Get Behind

Job vacancies are at an all-time low and the fight for top talent is on! You will have a plethora of employment options. Start now to identify five to 10 companies that enact values that resonate with you. Do you value trust, hard work, efficiency? Find companies that value the same and their management philosophy will be well-aligned with your needs. Share this during the interview process to impress. - Christine Wzorek, White Label Advisors

6. Find A Mentor And Create A Plan

It can be difficult figuring out your next steps in this exciting time of your life. It’s important to set yourself up for success by preparing in advance. Network as early as possible and start planting the seed in your areas of interest with those you meet. Find a mentor already in the workforce, and create a plan for yourself with actionable steps to reach your goal by graduation. - Charles Ashworth, Copper

7. Identify What Makes You Unique

Help employers understand why you stand out from the crowd by focusing on accomplishments or attributes that make you unique and of which you are exceptionally proud. Be willing to take risks and put yourself out there. If employers aren't connecting with who you are, those are not employers with whom you want to align yourself. You have a right to find an employer who values you! - Sherrie Suski, Tricon American Homes

8. Build Your Professional Brand

It is important that college seniors be aware of how to brand themselves in a professional manner and be aware of how they act and speak to their new environment. This may mean a social media audit, the way we dress to an interview, the way we conduct ourselves at a networking event. Branding is also about how I speak and what I speak. All the lingo of school should be left in school. - Tasniem Titus, Dentsply Sirona

9. Globalize Your Thoughts And Actions

Today's workforce is global and multicultural. High school and college seniors can get a head start by participating in global projects and study-abroad opportunities or simply seeking a mentor globally. By demonstrating global thoughts and actions, the seniors can create a clear differentiation and announce their readiness to be successful leaders of the future. - Vineet Gambhir, Summit Partners

10. Clean Up Your Social Media Accounts

Recent graduates, go clean out your social media closet! You can bet that employers are looking at this, and if your social media looks like that of half the young people I know, it’s in dire need of an overhaul. Hide the accounts you don’t want people to see, delete embarrassing photos, get rid of any radical commentary and generally look like someone an adult wouldn’t mind employing. - Tracy Cote, Genesys

11. Make Your Resume Real-World Ready

It's critical that employers can envision candidates as successful employees. Students with relevant internship experiences stand out for me. Employers can understand that you needed income, but if all you've got on your resume is bartending and babysitting, it's harder for them to understand how you'll contribute in their environment. - Joyce Maroney, Kronos Incorporated

12. Close Your Skills Gap

Whether it's high school or college, students should prepare themselves for graduation by either volunteering or taking internships during holidays and vacation periods to bridge the gap between formal education and workplace needs. Students who demonstrate the skills and outcomes for which employers are looking will certainly stand out once they are ready to enter the workforce in any season. - Dr. Timothy J. Giardino, Cantata Health & Meta Healthcare IT Solutions

13. Improve Your Communication

Use every opportunity to practice your communication skills. About 70% of what we do in business relates to written and oral communication. Speak up in class every opportunity you have. Seek out chances to give oral presentations in front of peers. With experience, your skills will only improve so the key is seizing every opportunity you have to become a better communicator. - Heide Abelli, Skillsoft

###Master life skills

Starting university is, let’s be honest, pretty adult. Whether you’re leaving home to live on campus or taking advantage of the flexibility of online study, you are now in control of your learning. You’re studying something you are passionate about and, heads up, are going to have to be responsible for making the most of it.

Part of stepping into adulthood is getting to grips with life skills that are going to serve you well in your time at university – and beyond.

For instance, creating healthy habits. Sounds simple, but let’s be honest, it’s something we all have to work at. And putting those healthy routines in place early, can have a big impact on your time at uni. Just ask Lucy Pirrie, a Bachelor of Communication student at Charles Sturt.

“Developing effective exercise and sleep patterns is the best way to ensure your productivity. And it helps to keep you in a good mood! Remember to get a good night’s sleep so you can accomplish more the next day.”

Or time management. Useful for study, but also useful for when you start working and even if you choose to have kids.

Check out the top life skills to master before starting uni.

###Sort your finances

Dollars and cents. Let’s just call them a necessary part of starting university. It could be your first time making a budget, paying bills or simply opening a bank account. Student finance is definitely something to get a grip on.

We sat down with Rachel Ayton, Student Welfare and Finance Adviser at Charles Sturt University, to chat all things student finance.

“We know that some students might experience a small degree of financial stress during their time at university – but we also know that being prepared can help reduce that stress. It’s important to find out upfront and right at the beginning of study what the costs will be, so you can prepare accordingly.”

So, we asked Rachel for her top three tips for sorting your student finances before starting university.

Make a (realistic) budget. The most important, but also most overlooked, tip. Sit down and create a budget. It might seem like an overly simple, basic task – but we promise it will have a huge impact on your finances. If you note every single expense you have, you’ll have a good idea of where you stand.
Apply for scholarships and grants. At Charles Sturt, we offer more than $3million in scholarships and grants every year. That’s a lot – we know! Our most important tip? You’ve got to be in it to win it!
Use your student card. This card is your golden ticket to a range of discounts. For example, most technology companies offer student discounts on their products (think Apple, Microsoft and Samsung), as well as many local restaurants, cafés and pubs. So make sure you keep an eye out. And it never hurts to ask!

###Learn to cook

If you’re moving out of home, it could well be the first time you’re going to have to feed yourself. Or, at least, cook for yourself. But, you know what – cooking is fun, and it’s a great way to share the good life with your new housemates.

So learning to cook is an awesome skill to master before starting university. Besides the communal factor, there are two other very good reasons for this.

First, cooking for yourself is – almost always – the healthier option. And you know what they say: healthy body, healthy mind. Cooking seasonal ingredients (so they are at their best and most nutritious) and controlling what goes into your food in terms of things like salt and sugar is going to make you feel better and have more energy. That’s just science!

The second important reason for learning to cook is that homemade meals are  – almost always – cheaper that store-bought meals. You’re not paying for the ‘construction’ of a dish – you do that. And, by the way, no-one needs to buy pre-cut carrots! Plus, usually, you don’t use as much packaging when you buy separate ingredients. So learning to cook is greener too.

With all those reasons, what’s not to like? But you might be asking: “I haven’t cooked before; where do I start?”

Never fear. We’ve got some recipes that will get you cooking up a storm – in a good way – in no time. Even better, there are recipes for one, two, four or six people, so whoever you’re cooking for, you’ve got a delicious dish up your sleeve.

Omelette
Jacket potatoes
Spaghetti bolognaise
Vegetarian nachos
Get your recipes.

###Get organised

When you’re starting university, it can seem like you have got so much to do. From applying for your top accommodation option and sorting out a tax file number (yep, you’ll need one of those), to checking out the reading lists for your subjects to deciding which fancy dress costume is going to make the biggest splash – the list can look a bit… stressy.

Well, never fear. We’ve put together a list of tips, tricks and hacks to help you get organised and help you avoid stress city. Here’s the top 10.

Accept your offer to Charles Sturt University now!
Book a campus tour and get familiar with your new surroundings before the session starts.
Connect with us on social media and keep up with everything that’s happening.
Touch base with accommodation services to confirm where you’ll be living.
Buy a planner, diary or calendar (paper or electronic – whatever works for you). It’s the best way to keep track of upcoming assessments, exams, work placements or other commitments.
Learn how to cook a few basic recipes. Sorry guys, two-minute noodles don’t qualify. But boiling an egg does!
If you’re relocating to study, get among your new town. Make a point of checking out local attractions, cool hangouts and community events.
Spend quality time doing some fun things with your family and friends before you head off on your uni journey.
Put together a list of everything you need to pack. Try not to go overboard though – you’ll only need half as much as you think you do!
Start saving now! Get your finances sorted and avoid the dreaded phone call to the ‘rents promising to come home and do all the housework for free next break for emergency cash.
Want more tips? Check out the full list of 50!

Discover the uni library
Students studying in Charles Sturt library
Okay, this might not be the most fun with a capital F part of your uni experience – but it is one of the most important.

The uni library is your go-to resource for your studies. Aside from the obvious benefit of borrowing books, there’s so much more you can do at the uni library. For example, for most of your assignments, you’ll need to do some research. The library can help you with skill development and workshops to help you find the best resources that will help you complete your assessments – and get top marks!

Add in free tutorials and workshops to get you comfortable finding what you need, as well as meeting rooms to work with your fellow students on projects, and even a YouTube channel packed with handy hints, tips and hacks – and the uni library will be your new favourite place (well, maybe).

And if you’re studying online, you can get books posted to you free of charge!

###Explore your uni library

Get set to smash Orientation
Group of university students covered in paint
So your first day at university – at least at Charles Sturt University – you won’t be straight into your lectures and tutorials. No, you’ll be in orientation!

Orientation is a couple of days that will get you prepped and primed to start uni. Yes, there will be course and study sessions to get you up to speed the academic side of things. And yes, you’ll hear from staff about the best way to find your way around you campus and your online portal.

But orientation is also your chance to meet people, make your first connections, check out clubs and societies and, you know, have some fun. We cover everything from the academic to social sides of uni, and you can discover the support available to you throughout your journey at Charles Sturt.

Then you’ll be really ready for starting university!
## Moving out of home
Expand all | Collapse all

When is the right time to leave home?
When it comes to making a choice about when to leave home, it’s good to remember that everyone is different. Some people choose to stay in their family home until they are well into their 30s or older, and others decide to leave as soon as they are able. In Australia, most people stay with their parents until they are at least 18 years old and your parents will remain your legal guardians until then. For more information about when you can legally leave home visit the Youth Law Australia website.

How do I make such a big decision?
Before you decide to move out of home, think about:

what are some of the advantages and disadvantages in terms of your emotional, physical, mental and financial wellbeing?
what impact will this have on your life now and in the future?
do you have a realistic idea of what to expect?
do you have a safe place to go?
are you ready to look after yourself?
Chatting with a Kids Helpline counsellor is one way to get help in considering these questions and making a decision that is right for you. You can talk to a counsellor by email, online chat or phone on 1800 55 1800.


Are you safe?
Many young people face the challenge of finding safe and supportive accommodation when they are forced to leave home because of abuse or family conflict. If this applies to you, think about using the following supports:

if you think you might be in immediate danger, call emergency services on Triple Zero (000)
get help from friends, other family members or an adult that you trust
contact your local police service (particularly if you are younger than 18 years old)
call or visit your local community health centre—they can provide you with information about safe and supportive accommodation
call Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 to get immediate support and assistance as well as referral to crisis accommodation services near you.

Choosing a place to live
There are a lot of things to think about when you’re choosing where to live and who to live with. For example, you may need to choose a location that not only suits your rental budget, but is also close to public transport and facilities.

Many young people share accommodation with others in order to split the cost of rent and utilities, such as electricity and gas. However, for those who have a steady income, there is also the choice to live alone. There are positives and negatives with both arrangements.

Some of the positives of shared accommodation are sharing the financial burden of rent/utilities, the opportunity to make new friends, and safety—living with others can provide extra security.

Some of the negatives of shared accommodation can include issues with keeping the house/flat clean—whose turn is it to wash the dishes, flatmates who don't pay bills/rent on time, and differences in lifestyle or values that may cause conflict.

Some young people deal with these issues by establishing clear ground rules with their fellow housemates at the start of the tenancy. This could mean making decisions about:

sharing the cost of rent and utilities
whether food is to be shared or everyone is to buy their own
sharing responsibility for household chores
rules about noise, visitors and parties
withdrawal from the rental lease when someone is moving out.
Once you have decided on a location and whether or not to share or live on your own, there are a number of ways that you can search for a place to rent. You can:

look online—there are websites that have descriptions and photos of rental properties, and you can search by suburb, price and type of accommodation (e.g. unit, townhouse or house)
visit real estate agencies in your chosen area to get a current rental list.
When you find a place that you’re happy with, you’ll need to complete an application form and pay a bond (this is usually equal to about 4 weeks of rent). In Queensland, the Residential Tenancies Authority (not the real estate agent) holds the bond, which is a deposit to make sure you keep the property in good condition.

Before you sign a lease agreement:

Make sure you understand the conditions of the lease and your responsibilities. If you’re unsure, then it's best to ask for help from the Residential Tenancies Authority or Tenants Queensland.
Inspect the property. Take careful note of anything that is damaged and tell the agent or landlord. It's a good idea to take photos of anything that is broken or needs repair and keep these for your own records.
How secure is the property? Sometimes you can request extra security for windows and doors, before you move in.

How much money will I need?
If you have a job, you’ll need to work out how much it will cost to cover your rent, bond, food, utilities and transport needs. If you’re not working or you’re a student then you can contact Centrelink to find out if you are eligible to receive any social security benefits.

Moving can be expensive. If you plan ahead, and get some help from others, there are lots of ways to save money. Here are some practical ideas on how you can move without blowing your budget:

see if you can get your friends, parents, or other family members to give you a hand, as removalists can be expensive
shop for furniture at second-hand stores—you will not only save yourself money, but you will be helping the environment by recycling
make a list of what you will need and what you can do without and only buy the essential items to begin with (for example, consider using a laundromat rather than buying a washing machine).

How will I feel when I leave home?
It is important to remember that leaving home is an emotional transition for most people. You might experience a range of emotions that are sometimes contradictory.

Depending on your situation, leaving home might be exciting, or scary, and with any big life change, there is loss involved. Moving home might mean that you feel sadness about the changes in the relationship with your parents, or you might feel lonely and disoriented if you have moved into a new area or neighbourhood.

Even though these are normal responses, it’s important to take care of yourself and your feelings by reaching out to others. Staying in touch with friends and trustworthy family members is important and can help with managing these feelings. Contacting your local community centre, or engaging with services like Kids Helpline, are great ways to make sure you're connected to others and taking care of yourself.

## Starting a family
t can feel like everyone has an opinion on when to have babies.

The average age of first-time parenthood is now 29.3, having steadily increased over the past few decades — and for some women, the societal pressure to feel they "should" start a family at a certain age is overwhelming.

We talked to three Australian mums about the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a parent in your 20s, 30s or 40s, and the personal factors they weighed up when making that decision.

'I had a comfortable pregnancy, and energy to burn'
For Maddi Brady of Wollongong in NSW, 23 was the perfect age to have a baby.

"My husband's got a trade and he's the one that's following a career, and I've never had an interest in it, really; I'd prefer to be a mum," says Maddi, who has a certificate in aged care and previously worked as retail assistant for a supermarket chain.

She's looking forward to having many decades to spend with her two sons, aged two years and five months old.

"I'm young enough that I can play with them and enjoy them and hopefully be around when they have children of their own."

Maddi also appreciates having youthful energy to help her endure the physical trials of having a young child.

"I think being younger my body doesn't struggle as much with sleep deprivation, and also carrying the babies I just feel better," she says.

"I never had back ache and feet ache, none of that stuff. I could even touch my toes perfectly fine all the way up to when he was born."

But one disadvantage is having few friends at the same life stage.

"I've had to go out and find other mummies so I can get help and that support network from other people I don't know," she says.

Perhaps the most significant benefits to starting a family young are the greater chances of conception — and lowered risk of miscarriage, pregnancy complications, gestational diabetes and birth defects — compared to older-than-average mums.

When she became a mum at 23, Maddi was about a decade below the age at which a woman's fertility begins to decline.

Women who have babies young, like Maddi, also have a better shot at reaching their ideal family size, which most Australian women don't get the chance to do, according to the 2017 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey.

As for Maddi and her husband? They'd like a large family, but the exact number they settle on will depend on income.

"We at least want two [more], depending on our financial situation," she says.

'I've had time for professional and personal fulfilment'
Sofia Todorova, a lawyer living on the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria, had her first daughter at 36.

Crucial to Sofia — who has a masters in human rights law — was the chance to study and develop a career before raising children.

"Having my children in my 30s has given me time for career development," she says.

"This grants me independence and personal fulfilment, which are important examples to pass to my daughters."

She's also had the chance to go on adventures, learn from her mistakes, and have some fun before settling into motherhood.

"In my 20s I've been able to do some of my favourite things, including time for travel," says Sofia, who has travelled widely and lived in London.

"I had the opportunity to be a mother in my 20s but chose not to follow that path. I feel I am better emotionally equipped to mother this time around and can bring a richer volume of experience to my daughters' lives."

She recently welcomed her second baby, at age 38. Both pregnancies were complication-free.

“I approach parenting with a calmness and confidence that I learned with age,” Sofia says.(Supplied: Sofia Todorova)
Women who give birth later than the national median age, like Sofia, often use the extra years to develop their careers and finish their studies.

One clear benefit of this is that higher levels of education in mothers is consistently associated with positive outcomes in their children's health and education.

And research out of The University of Texas have suggested women can delay parenthood until their late 20s or early 30s with no general risk to future health.

"Indeed, the results imply that such delay may improve health throughout life," researcher John Mirowsky says.

'Maturity and financial security were benefits for me'
Jaimee Ratcliff had her son at 40, and is now expecting her second child, a daughter, at 42.

She and her husband underwent IVF, getting lucky on their first try.

"It was all a very consciously planned thing," she says.

"I went, 'Listen, if you want kids then we need to do this now.'"

Having babies in her 40s has allowed Jaimee, an executive, to establish financial security, own her own home, and bring a level of maturity to her new role.

Readiness feels different for everyone — but personally, Jaimee feels that she's is a better parent for delaying parenthood past her 30s.

"I wasn't ready [earlier] and didn't have the mindset or life experiences that have helped me," she says.

But there have been drawbacks to having babies on the later side, says Jaimee, who is based in Werribee, Victoria.

Her fitness and energy levels aren't what they were in her 20s, and she's had to step away from her career during her "peak earning years", she says.

Sadly, Jaimee has also missed out on seeing her children bond with her grandmother: Jaimee's mum passed away three weeks after Jaimee had her son.

"If I'd had them earlier it would have been lovely to have that with my mum and my children know her," she says.

Unpacking baby panic
You might not even know if you want a baby — but you've been told many times to hurry up before those eggs dry up. We asked the experts about dealing with that faint ticking in the pelvic region.

The core things kids need
Ultimately, whether you're 25 or 45, what makes a good parent is that your child feels loved, understood and is stimulated.

"What we do know for sure in terms of what kids benefit from is just a core set of things," says Australian Institute of Family Studies director Anne Hollonds.

One of those things is having a nurturing, non-violent parent or carer who tunes into their needs at an early age.

"So the parent can put their own needs aside periodically and just be there for the kids, and to take the time to learn how to communicate even [when their child is] an infant, and tap into their moods, so the child has an experience of being understood at a younger age," says Ms Hollonds.

A stimulating environment surrounding your growing child is also crucial.

An ideal environment for a growing baby involves "the parent talking to them, communicating, singing, helping the child to develop", says Ms Hollonds.

7. Volunteer and look for apprenticeships within your new field
Volunteering and apprenticeships are two effective ways to get practical experience in your new field. Explore your local area for volunteering opportunities relevant to your new career. For example, if you have an interest in becoming a teacher, volunteering as a reading tutor could help you develop your career skills.
Apprenticeships can help you train for your new profession by allowing you to work full-time alongside an experienced mentor. Some fields also have mandatory apprenticeship programs for any aspiring professional who wants to pursue them. Careers that may offer or require apprenticeships include:
accounting
agriculture
animal care
carpentry
construction
cosmetology
electrical
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning installation
mechanical
plumbing
welding

8. Look for part-time or freelance opportunities
The first phase in earning money from your new career is likely to be taking a part-time or freelance job. Both can be low-responsibility methods to develop new skills and gain experience in your chosen career. Freelancing may also develop into a full-time occupation. Freelance jobs include:
accountant

Research your new career thoroughly before making a decision. Since this is a major change, performing thorough research before deciding on your new career can help you choose an appropriate new profession. Absorb as much information as you can before making your final decision.
Seek informational interview opportunities with relevant professionals. An informational interview is a conversation between someone seeking knowledge on a career and an experienced professional in that field. Finding a suitable person to communicate with can reveal industry insights and other useful information.
Consider a new career in the same industry. When seeking a new profession, it may be appropriate to research potential new jobs. This can help make the transition easier, as you're likely to require similar skills, educational certifications, and knowledge.
Use your personal network to get more information on potential new careers. You can ask friends and family to provide feedback regarding their careers to determine if any of them are likely to be appropriate for you. You may discover a job you may have an interest in that you are yet to consider.
## work to retirement
Preparing to retire is emotional and practical. Making a retirement plan can help you manage your finances, and cope better as your life and priorities change.

Make a retirement plan
Your retirement plan can be simple or detailed. Include:

Timing — when you want to retire. This could change, but it's good to have a starting point.
Lifestyle and priorities — prioritise what matters most. For example, social activities and staying active, continuing or changing work, where you will live.
Income and living costs — estimate your daily living costs. Do a budget to prioritise your spending. Work out how much income you'll have, and from where.
Plan for the future — if you can, boost your retirement income by contributing more to your super. Decide how to pay off your mortgage or other debts, and build a savings buffer. Check you have an up-to-date will and powers of attorney.
Think about when you want to retire
There's no set age you need to be to retire. It will depend on your health, work options, finances and personal situation.

Are you retiring in ten years, two to five years, or next year? If you have a partner, when will they retire? Knowing how much time you have helps you make a retirement plan.

Talk about your retirement priorities with a partner, colleague or friend. If you need professional advice to plan for retirement, see financial advice.

Consider your lifestyle and priorities
Set your priorities
Think about what your lifestyle will look and feel like. What are the things that matter most?

Consider:

your living costs
social life and recreation
staying active and healthy
volunteering or community participation
planning for changing health needs or aged care
supporting your family, children or grandchildren (if any)
Keep working, reduce hours or retrain
Continuing to earn an income, even part-time, can help your retirement savings last longer. If you want to keep working, options include:

Job Switch — explore options to retrain or seek part-time work
Transition to retirement — if you've reached your preservation age

, you can use some of, and keep contributing to, your super while working
Work Bonus — if you get the Age Pension, you can earn up to $300 per fortnight from work before your pension payment reduces
Plan where you will live
If you own your home:

If you still have a mortgage, you could use some of your super (when available) to pay it off.
Consider downsizing to free up money. You could pay off your mortgage, support your lifestyle, or relocate to be closer to family or services. Before going ahead, check the tax impact and whether it will affect your government benefits.
If you're renting:

You may be eligible for an extra payment if you rent and get payments from Centrelink, like the Age Pension. To find out more, see rent assistance on the Services Australia website.
If you're struggling with rent or unsure about your tenancy rights, see rent steps to take on the National Debt Helpline website.
Work out your income and living costs
How much money you'll need for living costs in retirement depends on your lifestyle priorities and what you can afford.

For most people, your retirement income will be a combination of superannuation and the Age Pension. If you don't have much super, you may be more reliant on the pension. If you do have super, think about how and when to withdraw it. You may also have some savings or investments.

Work out your living costs
Consider:

Housing — rent or mortgage, rates, home and contents insurance, maintenance
Utilities — electricity, gas, water, phone, internet, streaming services
Food — fresh food, groceries, takeaway, dining out
Clothing and household goods — clothing, personal care, furniture, household appliances
Health and leisure — health insurance, health care, social activities, fitness, holidays, gifts
Transport — car registration, insurance and running costs, public transport
As a rule of thumb, try allowing for two thirds of your current living costs. This is a useful guide, that assumes reduced costs for work and that you've paid off your mortgage.

Your spending may be higher when you first retire. For example, if you plan to travel or update your home. You may also need to allow more for health care as you get older.

Use the budget planner to work out your living costs

Prioritise the things that matter most in retirement.

Get your super income
You can get your super when you retire and reach your 'preservation age'. That is between 55 and 60, depending on when you were born. Or when you reach 65, even if you're still working.

When you are eligible to withdraw your super, your main options are:

an account-based pension
an annuity
a lump sum
or a combination of these
You could also consider a transition to retirement strategy. You can use some of, and keep contributing to, your super while working.

Contact your super fund to discuss your options.

Claim government benefits
From age 67 (or earlier, if born before 1957), you may be eligible for government benefits such as:

Age Pension
Pensioner concessions
Health care benefits
Tax offsets
For questions about government benefits, call Centrelink's older Australians line on 132 300. Ask to speak to a Financial Information Service (FIS) officer (for free). The helpline is open Monday to Friday, 8:00am to 5:00pm.

Use the retirement planner to estimate your income

See how long your super and Age Pension will last.

Add in savings and investments
If you have money in savings, this could top up your retirement income.

If you have investments like shares or investment property, think about whether to keep or sell. Check the costs, tax impact and whether it will affect your government benefits.

Plan for the future
Grow your income
If you can, consider contributing more to your super. Use the super contributions optimiser to see how to get the biggest boost.

Save for an emergency
Save an emergency fund to give yourself a safety net for unexpected bills like repairs or medical costs.

Pay off debt
If you have a mortgage or other debts, consider how best to pay them off. For tips on how to do this, see get debt under control.

Make an estate plan
Decide what you want done with your assets when you die. Check you have an up-to-date will and powers of attorney, and a nominated beneficiary for your super.

Get help if you need it
To get advice about your super income options, talk to your super fund.
For questions about government benefits or retirement, call Centrelink's older Australians line on 132 300. Ask to speak to a Financial Information Service (FIS) officer (for free). The helpline is open Monday to Friday, 8:00am to 5:00pm.

# Book Review - Friday Journal
The book I read this term was "General Science, I used to know that." It's an amazing book about all the things you may of forgotten about science in highschool, from biology to atoms, from E=mc^2 to the periodic table. I would recommend this book to any lover of science and how the world works/ it goes into depth and does it in a way thats enjoyable and easy to read. it has mutliple sections including physics, chemistry, biology. each with their own sub sections.

Physics:
energy and electricity
forces
waves, radiation and space

Chemistry:
the periodic table
fuels, air, pollution
metals
organic chemistry

biology:
Human (and other) bodies
cell biology
evolution and enviroment ecology
genetics

This book covers a lot yet still remains an amazing, and easy to learn view into science.
This is one of my favourite books because it is entertaining, while teaching me about my passion.
